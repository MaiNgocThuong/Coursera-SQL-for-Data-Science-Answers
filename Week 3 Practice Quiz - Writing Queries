SELECT artistid,
count (albumid) as total_album
FROM albums
WHERE artistid in (SELECT artistid
    FROM artists
    WHERE name = 'Led Zeppelin')


2.  Create a list of album titles and the unit prices for the artist "Audioslave".

- Using Left Join:
SELECT tracks.unitprice,
albums.title
FROM tracks
LEFT JOIN albums ON tracks.albumid = albums.albumid
WHERE albums.artistid In (SELECT artistid
    FROM artists
    WHERE name = 'Audioslave')

- Or Using Inner Join:
SELECT tracks.unitprice,
albums.title
FROM tracks
FROM albums
INNER JOIN artists on artists.artistid = albums.artistid

WHERE artists.name = 'Audioslave'

3.  Find the first and last name of any customer who does not have an invoice. Are there any customers returned from the query?  

SELECT customers.firstname, 
customers.lastname,
invoices.invoiceid
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN invoices 
ON customers.customerid = invoices.customerid
WHERE invoices.invoiceid is NULL

4.  Find the total price for each album.

SELECT albumid,
unitprice * count (albumid) as total_price
FROM tracks
GROUP BY albumid

What is the total price for the album “Big Ones”?

unitprice * count (albumid) as total_price
FROM tracks
WHERE albumid in (SELECT albumid
